HOW TO PREVIEW LOCALLY
----------------------
1. Open the email.html file in a web browser:

   - Right-click → Open With → Browser, or
   - Drag and drop into browser window

2. Note: Local preview will show:
   - Placeholder text ({{event.sender_full_name}}, etc.)
   - Relative image paths (images/header-logo-gift.svg)
   - Links may not work (they use {{claim_link}} placeholder)

3. For accurate testing:
   - Use a local email testing tool (see below)
   - Upload to Litmus/Email on Acid
   - Send test emails to yourself

LOCAL EMAIL TESTING TOOLS
--------------------------
1. MailHog (https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog)
   - Captures emails sent from local development
   - View emails in web interface
   - Useful for testing email sending functionality

2. Mailtrap (https://mailtrap.io/)
   - Free tier available
   - Captures test emails
   - Preview in browser

3. Papercut (https://github.com/ChangemakerStudios/Papercut)
   - Simple SMTP server for testing
   - View emails in desktop app

HOW TO TEST VIA LITMUS
----------------------
1. Sign up for Litmus account (https://litmus.com/)
2. Upload email.html to Litmus
3. Replace placeholders with test data:
   - {{event.sender_full_name}} → "Kate"
   - {{customer.email}} → "test@example.com"
   - {{claim_link}} → "https://example.com/claim"

[ ] Spacing issues (check padding/margin values)
[ ] Rounded corners appearing square in Outlook (expected, but verify)
[ ] Shadows not appearing in Outlook (expected, but verify)
[ ] Gradient buttons not working in Outlook (VML should handle this)

NOTES
-----
- Outlook 2007-2016 use Word rendering engine, which has limited CSS support
- Some CSS properties (like border-radius, box-shadow) may not work in older Outlook
- VML is required for gradient buttons in Outlook
- Always test with images disabled to ensure email is still readable
- Test with different email lengths to ensure layout doesn't break
- Consider dark mode compatibility (if applicable)

TEST DATA TEMPLATE
